<h1 class="aboutheader">Meet the Team!</h1>
</section>
<p>Our team consists of 4 seperate developers, as well as our Project Manager. Creating the 'Chef Portfolio' was a collective effort from every member of the team, taking roughly 1 week to finish. Each role handles and develops different sections of the project, and this is the compiled result. Enjoy! </p>

<p>I (Brandon F.) was in charge of the creating the Marketing Page for the project, which consists of the home page, the about page, and all the styling that the user can see on the website. This portion of the project took 3-4 days to complete entirely, while the bare bones version was finished in roughly 1-2 days. </p>

<p> Schrese H. and Daniel F. developed the application portion of our project. Not only did these two do the React II portion of the project, they also did the React I portion, due to unforseen circumstances with our original team. Everything you see after you click the 'sign in' button was done by these guys, in conjunction with backend contributions from Marcellino.</p>

</section>
<p> Marcellino F. developed the backend (data structure) for the React II team to use. He's the one who made the database that Schrese + Daniel used to create the application itself. Marcellino worked closely with the React II team and even rewrote the database a couple times when necessary.</p>
